    Stairwell V1 HTTP APIs

    Restful APIs for the Stairwell platform. Most APIs expose named resources: each resource has a unique identifier that users use to reference that resource, and these names are what users should store as the canonical names for the resources. The base URL for this API is https://app.stairwell.com
