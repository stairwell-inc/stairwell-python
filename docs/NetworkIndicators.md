# NetworkIndicators

NetworkIndicators is a list hostnames and IPs that were extracted via static analysis. Ports are not included because they generally do not occur next to the hostname or IPs in the binary.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ip_addresses** | **List[str]** | ip_addresses is the list of IPs in the binary. | [optional] 
**uninteresting_ip_addresses** | **List[str]** | Address types which are typically not useful: private, global unicast and link local multicast IPs. | [optional] 
**hostnames** | **List[str]** | hostnames is the list of Hostnames in the the binary. | [optional] 
**improbable_hostnames** | **List[str]** | Hostnames which are technically valid, but are most likely noisy artifacts from static analysis. | [optional] 
**private_hostnames** | **List[str]** | This is a list of TLDs that are closed (or probably closed) to public registrations. These are generated by some manual analysis and data analysis from active dns data. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from stairwell_openapi_client.models.network_indicators import NetworkIndicators

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of NetworkIndicators from a JSON string
network_indicators_instance = NetworkIndicators.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print NetworkIndicators.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
network_indicators_dict = network_indicators_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of NetworkIndicators from a dict
network_indicators_form_dict = network_indicators.from_dict(network_indicators_dict)
